# ArrayADT
“To study an Array ADT and to implement various operations on an Array ADT.” Create an array and implement the operations – traverse(), insert_element(), delete_element(), sort(), search(), merge(), copy(), create(), isFull(), isEmpty() and length(). Write a C program to demonstrate an array ADT using defined operations appropriately using a menu-driven approach. Your program should be able to print the array contents appropriately at any or all instances (as required may be). You must also ensure that no input is acquired within the body of functions, nor (preferably) display any prompts/results.
